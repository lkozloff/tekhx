								<h2>Kichong Tran (ARC Hub PNH Founder)<br />
									<small>Lessons I Wish I Learned in School</small></h2>
									<p>Ki Chong will share about his experience as a business owner in Cambodia over the last 3 years and about some of the hard lessons that have come from it. Surprisingly, some of these ideas run in contrast to what is traditionally taught in schools. Blending his experiences as a business owner and as an educator with Liger, Development Innovations and CCF, he'll offer practical tips for teachers to give their lessons maximal life impact.</p>

								<p>Ki Chong graduated with honors from the University of California San Diego with a degree in International Economics. After nearly 4 years working in the aerospace industry as a project manager and international sales executive, he moved to Cambodia to start ARC Hub PNH with his brother Ki How. Ki Chong is driven by his love of adventure and travel as well as the belief that all people deserve equal access to opportunities and fair living standards regardless of where they were born.</p>

								<h2>Learning Integration using Minecraft (2 hour session)<br />
									<small>Matthew Dolmont (ISPP)</small></h2>
								<p>In this deep learning session, I will share examples on how videogames such as the infamous Minecraft can be leveraged to build student understanding of our world and our communities. In the first half of the session, we will examine a 5th grade unit studying animal trafficking and how Minecraft can be used as a tool to simulate a real world scenario in meaningful, engaging ways. I will share deployment tips, lesson plans and collaborative planning strategies for the development of integrated game-based lessons. In the second half, attendees will engage with one of these lesson plans, “playing” through a scenario as a typical 5th grade student in the role of a stakeholder in an animal trafficking scenario. We will then examine the outcomes of the virtual scenario and how it may relate to the world we live in. </p>

								<p>In this session, I will tell you a few stories of how we have used VoiceThread in Lower Elementary. The session will introduce VoiceThread and its purposes, will move on to discuss and show examples of how we have used it to further student learning and understanding of online communities and connected learning, and will perhaps end with a brainstorm of new uses that we can all think of. Also, I would hope that this session gives everyone experience in using and designing VoiceThreads that can be used in classes. <br/>
