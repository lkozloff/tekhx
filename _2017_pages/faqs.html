      <p>Below is a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).<p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>When will conference registrations be opened?</b>
              <br>We generally open registration for attendees 4 weeks before the conference.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li><b>What if I've never given a presentation before?</b>
              <br>We love beginners! If you're feeling confident, don't hesitate to submit
	      for a longer session, but first time presenters might enjoy the fast pace of
	      our "slam-dunk" style talks. 20 minutes isn't a lot of time to fill, but it's
	      enough to get you out there at your first conference!<br><br>
