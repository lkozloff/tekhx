topic: Decent Discussions through Digital Deconstructed Debates (Slam-Dunk)
description: Ah the golden age of communications! The dissemination of great and noble ideas. The cross-cultural conversations. The enrichment of understanding between peoples... Or perhaps the age of false information, baseless opinions, arguments where people don’t hear each other.  The web holds many opportunities for communication across vast borders both literal and symbolic. Yet anyone who has been on social media- in the early days ‘forums’ and now comment feeds- would have observed disagreements which achieved naught but soured relations.  This session is about introducing a useful piece of web based software that helps groups to have concise discussions about various issues. It is useful in the classroom both to have debates and to observe the nuances of public debate. It is useful in planning meetings where ideas are being floated and pros/ cons and other matters are being discussed. It is useful as an individual, to clarify your own thought processes. Come along and find out more!
